                            To adapt Dorothy Parker, the PM ran the full gamut of emotion from strong to stable. Her primary means of showing solidarity with workers is to deliver answers so robotic that they suggest even her own job has already been automated. What was she going to do about rising food prices, someone wanted to know? “We need to make sure we get that Brexit deal right.” What about Labour’s manifesto policies polling well? “Ordinary working families will suffer from a coalition of chaos.” What does she think about reports that Donald Trump disclosed highly sensitive intelligence to the Russians? “It is not up to me what President Trump says to anybody that he is meeting and talking to.” Life insurers now insist that you declare if you have been exposed to a Theresa May response, with failure to disclose the fact liable to render your policy void. Outside the Screwfix gates, even the Mirror chicken looked like it wanted to turn itself in to the nearest Nando’s.

                            On Monday, and apparently for the first time this campaign, Theresa May was accosted by an unscreened, unvetted, unscripted member of the public in Oxfordshire’s Abingdon market. Tuesday’s event sent a clear message: LOL if you think I’m doing that again. The encounter in Abingdon, you may have seen, saw the prime minster confronted by a woman wanting to know what she was going to do for people with learning disabilities, only for May to reply: “We have got a lot of plans for mental health.” Impressive that the PM should contrive to imagine learning disabilities and mental health are the same thing – then again, she was once shadow secretary of state for the work and pensions, the department where the Tories traditionally earn their teardrop tattoos.

                                    Setting the foreground color to go with the background colors wasn’t absolutely
                                    necessary, but it’s always a good idea. Now we have two non-floated elements
                                    (#wrapper, #content) with no visible background, and a page with a white background.

                                    You might be worried that Navigator 4.x does terrible things with the value
                                    transparent, but be of good cheer: NN4.x only pays attention to style sheets that
                                    have a media value of screen. Just like with @import, the styles in our print style
                                    sheet are forever hidden from Navigator 4’s rheumy eyes. So no worries there.
